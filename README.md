## My_Tu_Verras
We are going to work on a Boston housing prices dataset. </br> 
Basically what a data scientist would want to do with such a dataset is to build a model to predict the value.</br> 
In this case, the MEDV,based on the different other attributes like the number of rooms, the distance to schools etc. Here, we are not going to make any predictions from models, but we are going to try and understand what the data has to tell us.
